## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First tried to use CSS Grid and a Picture element to position the elements on the desktop version, but i couldn't get the hero image to span across all the rows. To solve that, positioned two different pictures on the HTML, using displat none and block to alternate between each version. To validate the e-mail, I learned about RegEx expressions, addEventListener and preventDefault. 

### Continued development

Wanna do some reserch to see if there are better options to position the message error icon, since it was the hardest part to deal with.
